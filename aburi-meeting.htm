  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s213" style="left: 462.03px; top: 766.57px; width: 151px;">The Main Topic: </span>
  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s214" style="left: 426.37px; top: 795.05px; width: 217px;">Re-Organizing Nigeria</span>

  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s213" style="left: 397.98px; top: 880.51px; width: 274px;">January 1966-July 1967 (Vol.1)</span>
  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s213" style="left: 322.52px; top: 909px; width: 425px;">A. H. M. KIRK-GREENE Oxford University, 1971</span>
  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s214" style="left: 444.98px; top: 994.46px; width: 185px;">Attitudes at Aburi </span>
  <span class="xr_tc Normal_Text xr_s213" style="left: 340.82px; top: 1051.43px; width: 393px;">a. How the military looks at the politicians </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1108.41px;">General Ankrah (Ghana): I will not like to dwell rigidly on any point whatsoever because I feel this is a domestic affair of Nigeria </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1133.18px;">and, as I have always said, it is not difficult for military people to understand each other. It is a saying that if Generals were to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1157.95px;">meet and discuss frontiers, wars or even go into the details to forestall war, there will never be any differences or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1182.72px;">discrepancies but unity and understanding. There will be no war because the two old boys will meet at the frontier and tell </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1207.5px;">each other: 'Old boy, we are not going to commit our boys to die, come on, let us keep the politicians out' and that is the end. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1232.27px;">am quite confident that having met here to-day, you will continue and achieve what you are here for. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1281.81px;">What I want to stress is this, that through the annals of history we have not seen failures with military statesmen and when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1306.58px;">military personnel do take over the reins of Government they have proved their worth and, I am sure and confident that the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1331.36px;">Military regimes that have been saddled with the onerous responsibility of rebuilding and reconstructing the various countries </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1356.13px;">in Africa will not let us down. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1405.67px;">You are aware that in Nigeria now the whole world is looking up to you as military men and if there is any failure to reunify or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1430.44px;">even bring perfect understanding to Nigeria as a whole, you will find that the blame will rest with us all through the centuries. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1455.22px;">There is no gainsaying this whatsoever. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1504.76px;">Whatever the situation we are soldiers and soldiers are always statesmen not politicians. They deal with a little bit of politics </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1529.53px;">and diplomacy when the time comes but they are statesmen. The people first and they themselves second but if you think like </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1554.3px;">the politicians do that they want fame or they want to be heard of and neglect your people then, of course, I am quite sure </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1579.08px;">that we as soldiers will live to regret, even our future generations will live to regret. They will be blaming us whenever our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1603.85px;">names are called or mentioned.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1653.39px;">Major Johnson: Gentlemen, if I can start talking on this one, please do not think I am taking undue advantage. Quite honestly I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1678.16px;">think we all know what brought this country to where we are to-day and while talking yesterday Emeka [first name of Lt.-Col. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1702.94px;">Ojukwu] touched on a point of how, due to the situation, the politicians got what they have been waiting for to come in. While I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1727.71px;">very much welcome this Item 4 and while I know that definitely we are not going to be in Government forever, I will like to say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1752.48px;">that, please for the next six months let us leave everything that will bring the politicians back into the limelight out of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1777.25px;">question. Let us go on all these things we have been discussing since yesterday because this is on the basis at which we can </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1802.02px;">get our country back on its feet. Once we can get the papers on these things out and we see them working then we can call </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1826.8px;">the Ad Hoc Constitutional Committee to come and discuss but for now they are just going to confuse the issues more if you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1851.57px;">bring them out to come and talk anything again. I will say let the Military Government continue for now and after working for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1876.34px;">six months and we see how far we can go before we start thinking of calling these people back. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1925.88px;">Commodore Wey: I 100% support what you have said. Candidly if there had ever been a time in my life when I thought </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1950.66px;">somebody had hurt me sufficiently for me to wish to kill him it was when one of these fellows opened his mouth too wide. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 1975.43px;">think we should let them stay where they are for the moment. It was simply because we could not get together and handle our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2000.2px;">affairs. Now that we have established the basis under which we can work please let us leave them where they are and let us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2024.97px;">try and see how far we can work. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2074.52px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: On this statement, Gentlemen, a lot depends on what the Ad Hoc Constitutional Committee is. I agree indeed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2099.29px;">that regarding other Regions it was indeed a platform for politicians, in the East it was not. I did not send politicians to it but be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2124.06px;">it as it may, if we say we are going to continue then we must obviously get quite satisfied the terms of running this thing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2148.83px;">properly. We have got to be able to meet and I said it outside and I repeat it here, I, as the Military Governor of the East cannot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2173.6px;">meet anywhere in Nigeria where there are Northern troops. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2223.15px;">b. The events of 29 July and the issue of Supreme Commander: the Colonels speak </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2272.69px;">Major Johnson: Sir, before we go on if I may say something. I am happy we have got to this point again. I had wanted to take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2297.46px;">this Conference back all along because as my people say 'If you still have lice in your head, there will still be blood on your </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2322.24px;">fingers :' May I ask one question, gentlemen, is there a Central Government in Nigeria to-day? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2371.78px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: That question is such a simple one and anyone who has been listening to what I have been saying all the time </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2396.55px;">would know that I do not see a Central Government in Nigeria to-day. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2446.1px;">Major Johnson: Thank you, Gentlemen. I think this is the crux of the whole thing and I think if I can take you back this can be a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2470.87px;">personality clash or something. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2520.41px;">I am saying here to-day that this is the backbone of our problem. As far as the Governor of the East is concerned there is no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2545.18px;">central government in Nigeria. You say, Supreme Commander, but as far as he is concerned there is no Supreme Commander. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2569.96px;">I think this is where we must start from, gentlemen. Why is he not accepting that there is a Supreme Commander and we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2594.73px;">accept there is a Supreme Commander. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2644.27px;">This brings me to this Conference that was held in August. As was rightly said, this Committee was a Steering Committee. We </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2669.04px;">are all Military personnel here and we know one thing. We have all been pointing accusing fingers at politicians that they used </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2693.82px;">to take military decisions without military men. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2743.36px;">The main problem now is that as far as the East is concerned, there is no Central Government. Why? This is what we must find </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2768.13px;">out. I mentioned something about personality clash. I remember that there was a long letter written by the Governor of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2792.9px;">East sometime ago referring to the hierarchy in the Army, the policy on seniority and things like that. He said among other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2817.68px;">things in the letter that if even Lt.-Col. Yakubu Gowon is Supreme Commander is he not right to ask whether it is for a period </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2842.45px;">or something. For all the East knows the former Supreme Commander is only missing and until such a time that they know his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2867.22px;">whereabouts they do not know any other Supreme Commander. These are the points that have been brought out by the East. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2916.76px;">Gentlemen, we said this morning that we have come with open minds and we must hit the nail at the head. The East should </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2941.54px;">tell us now what are their views, what are the conditions they want to demand before they can say that there is a Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2966.31px;">Government in Nigeria. For all we know now, nobody has seceded, the East is still part of Nigeria, the West, the North and we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 2991.08px;">know Nigeria as a Federation. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3040.62px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: The Mid-West please. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3090.17px;">Major Johnson: And Lagos. Nigeria is still a Federation and in a Federation there is a Central Government. Where is this Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3114.94px;">Government and who is Head of this Central Government? Gentlemen, unless we clear this one, all what we are discussing will </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3139.71px;">not be good enough. What are the conditions the East demand before they can recognise what the rest of us recognise as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3164.48px;">Central Government? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3189.26px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I agree with you in essence on what you have just said, Bolaji [First name of Major Johnson], but the last bit is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3214.03px;">badly put. If you will forgive me it is not 'What conditions do they demand before....' </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3263.57px;">If the problem is that we are trying to see how to solve the problem of Government in the centre then I will come in. I will seek </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3288.34px;">your indulgence as I go a little bit back into what a number of people would perhaps wish to call history.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3337.89px;">At a certain stage, we all accepted General Ironsi as the Supreme Commander and Head of the National Military Government. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3362.66px;">During his regime we met or rather whilst he was about we met as often as it was practicable, and sat and jointly discussed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3387.43px;">and took decisions. When the decisions were good we all shared the kudos, when those decisions were bad it is only natural </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3412.2px;">that we should all share the blame. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3461.75px;">On the 29th of July, whilst he was visiting the Governor of the West, he was said to be besieged in that residence in Ibadan and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3486.52px;">later kidnapped, further abducted. Subsequent to that, it appeared in his absence the normal thing was whoever is the next </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3511.29px;">senior person to manage the affairs of this country until such a time as he reappeared; or it was necessary he was deposed or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3536.06px;">if he had suffered certain accident, until such a time as the circumstances were made known. Which ever is the case, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3560.84px;">question of the headship of the Government and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces would normally be subjected </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3585.61px;">to a discussion and agreement unless, of course, one party felt he was strong enough to push everybody aside and get to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3610.38px;">seat. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3659.92px;">When this affair of the 29th July occurred, I remember for certain, the first 24 hours nobody thought it necessary to contact </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3684.7px;">the East from Lagos. I made the contact later and I know the advice I gave Brigadier Ogundipe at that time. I said to him, 'Sir, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3709.47px;">the situation is so confused that I feel that somebody must take control immediately. Also, I would suggest that you go on to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3734.24px;">the air and tell the country what has happened and that you were taking control of the situation.' Then I was told about </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3759.01px;">concern for the whole country. I knew that if this thing resolved itself into factions we would get ourselves into so much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3783.78px;">trouble that we would never or we would find it difficult to get out. I maintained and still do that the answer would have been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3808.56px;">for the responsible officers of the Army to get together thereby trying to get the Army together to solve the problem that we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3833.33px;">had on our hands. I said to him 'As soon as you have made your speech I guarantee you within 30 minutes, I needed time to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3858.1px;">write my own, in 30 minutes I would come on to the air in the East and say that I, the entire Army in the East and the entire </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3882.87px;">people in the East wholeheartedly support you.' </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3932.42px;">Forgive me, David [first name of Lt.-Col. Ejoor], that I have never said this to you, but I told him too that I was sure that within </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3957.19px;">fifteen minutes you would say the same in the interest of the country as a whole. He told me that he thought it was a good </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 3981.96px;">idea but it did not seem likely that it would be accepted by the faction. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4031.5px;">Very soon after, I had occasion to talk to you, Jack [nickname of Lt.-Col. Gowon], I did mention amongst other things, two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4056.28px;">things. The first one was this question of solving the problem and I thought the Army together should solve it. I said also that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4081.05px;">any break at this time from our normalline would write in something into the Nigerian Army which is bigger than all of us and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4105.82px;">that thing is indiscipline. How can you ride above people's heads and sit in Lagos purely because you are at the Head of a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4130.59px;">group who have their fingers poised on the trigger? If you do it you remain forever a living example of that indiscipline which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4155.36px;">we want to get rid of because tomorrow a Corporal will think because he has his finger on the trigger he could just take over </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4180.14px;">the company from the Major Commanding the company and so on. I knew then that we were heading for something terrible. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4204.91px;">Despite that and by force of circumstance as we did talk on the telephone, I think twice, you brought up the question of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4229.68px;">supreme command and I made quite plain my objections, but despite those objections you announced yourself as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4254.45px;">Supreme Commander. Now, Supreme Commander by virtue of the fact that you head or that you are acceptable to people </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4279.22px;">who had mutinied against their Commander, kidnapped him and taken him away ? By virtue of the support of Officers and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4304px;">men who had in the dead of night murdered their brother Officers, by virtue of the fact that you stood at the head of a group </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4328.77px;">who had turned their brother Officers from the Eastern Region out of the barracks which they shared ? Our people came </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4353.54px;">home, there are other circumstances which even make the return more tragic. Immediately after I had opportunity to speak to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4378.31px;">you again, I said on that occasion that there had been too much killing in Nigeria and it was my sincere hope that we can stop </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4403.08px;">these killings. I said then, and have continued to say that in the interest of peace I would co-operate with you to stop the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4427.86px;">fighting, to stop the killing but I would not recognise. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4477.4px;">I would not recognise because as I said we have a Supreme Commander who is missing. I would not recognise and to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4502.17px;">underline the validity of that claim of mine you appointed another Officer, be he senior to you, Acting Governor in the West, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4526.94px;">presumably acting for the Governor who was then abducted and that I saw no reason why your position would not then be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4551.72px;">acting. From there I think we started parting our ways because it was clear that the hold on Lagos was by force of conquest. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4576.49px;">Now, these things do happen in the world, we are all military Officers. If an Officer is dead 'Oh! he was a fine soldier', we drop </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4601.26px;">the national flag on him, we give him due honours and that is all. The next person steps in. So, the actual fact in itself is a small </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4626.03px;">thing with military men but hierachy, order is very important, discipline are sine qua non for any organisation which prides </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4650.8px;">itself for being called an Army. So, the mutiny had occurred, the mutineer seemed in control of the North, the West, Lagos. By </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4675.58px;">international standards when that does happen then a de facto situation is created immediately where whoever is in a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4700.35px;">position get a de facto recognition of himself in a position over the area he controls. In this situation, Nigeria resolved itself </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4725.12px;">into three areas. The Lagos, West and North group, the Mid-West, the East. What should have been done is for us to get round </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4749.89px;">to discuss the future, how to carry on in the absence of our Supreme Commander.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4799.44px;">We could not get together because of the situation so we sent our accredited representatives, delegates of Governments and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4824.21px;">personal representatives of Governors to Lagos to try and resolve certain issues on bringing normalcy to the country. They </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4848.98px;">met and unanimously agreed to certain points.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4898.52px;">Bolaji, I think in fact from this, if nothing else you do know what I consider went wrong. Perhaps at this juncture I might stop </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4923.3px;">for others to contribute otherwise I would go on and tell you what I consider to be my solution to the problem even now, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4948.07px;">irrespective of the amount of water that had gone under the bridge. I think there is still a solution provided we are honest with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4972.84px;">ourselves and we are really very serious about solving this problem. I agree with you it is vital, it is crucial, without it I do not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 4997.61px;">think we can really go anywhere. I leave it for the time being. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5047.16px;">Col. Adebayo: I think Emeka has narrated what happened on the 29th July and thereafter. We have all agreed and I am sure </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5071.93px;">you still agree that what we are looking for now is a solution for the future. I do not want us to go into the past anymore, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5096.7px;">want a solution for the future. I will suggest with the permission of the other members here that we ask Emeka to give us his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5121.47px;">solution. Thereafter there might be some others too who would have their own solutions, then we can make a compromise </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5146.24px;">from the solutions we get. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5195.79px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: Gentlemen, General Ankrah told us not to go back into the past, if we are to go back into the past we will sit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5220.56px;">here for two months talking. Let us forget the past and I agree with Robert [first name of Col. Adebayo] that we ask the East to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5245.33px;">tell us their solution. If their solution is quite acceptable then we adopt it, amend or whatever we think is good for the country </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5270.1px;">for peace. We are not going to say ourselves what efforts we have put in individually; let us find peace for Nigeria. This is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5294.88px;">major issue, unless this is done whatever we are going to discuss is not going to work out well.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5344.42px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: I believe that before we start suggesting solutions we must examine certain principles vis a vis the Governors. To </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5369.19px;">me, we should not go too far into history but there is one valid point which must be considered and that is the coup we have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5393.96px;">had so far. The January 15 one was a failure and the Army came in to correct it, the one of the 29th I personally believe was a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5418.74px;">mutiny to start with but it has now turned out to be a coup. If it is a coup we have to ask ourselves 'is it a successful coup or is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5443.51px;">it a partial one ?' I believe it is a partial one, it is not a fully successful one. This is the main point which has brought us here, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5468.28px;">trying to negotiate as opposed to receiving orders from the Commander. I think we must bear this in mind in reaching a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5493.05px;">decision or a Resolution affecting the re-organisation of the Army. To-day, the Army is faced with four main problems. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5542.6px;">Firstly, the problem of leadership; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5592.14px;">Secondly, the crisis of confidence amongst Officers and amongst the soldiers; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5641.68px;">Thirdly, the chain of command is badly disrupted; and Fourthly, we cannot now have any Nigerian from anywhere serving in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5666.46px;">the same unit as an effective unit of the Army. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5716px;">These are bare facts and whatever solution we evolve must go to solve these main problems. I leave these basic principles and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5740.77px;">what solutions offered should be considered alongside these problems. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5790.32px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: David spoke on re-organisation but the current topic is on Bolaji's point which Emeka narrated. I think this is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5815.09px;">the major point. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5864.63px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: When you consider leadership you have to tell us what happened to the former leader. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5914.18px;">Commodore Wey: Gentlemen, I think I have been properly placed in this issue from the 15th of January up till now. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5938.95px;">Unfortunately, I do not put them down because I think I can carry quite a bit in my head. The whole issue is unfortunate, it has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5963.72px;">happened and it has happened. The truth now is that we want to repair, we do not intend to point accusing fingers at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 5988.49px;">anybody. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6038.04px;">When the trouble of the 29th July started I was present, you came and joined us, therefore, I can tell any other person better. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6062.81px;">was there when you phoned Brigadier Ogundipe and I knew what you said. At one stage, it was even said that I carried him in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6087.58px;">my ship and took him out to sea. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6137.12px;">I must say one thing that it is impossible for any man to expect to command any unit which he has not got control over. Bolaji </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6161.9px;">would bear witness, he was there, he started it. He was the one who went out first and came back to say that a Private refused </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6186.67px;">to take orders from him; it all happened in the Police Headquarters.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6236.21px;">The Inspector-General complained, I went into it and I said if they cannot take orders from an Army Officer like themselves </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6260.98px;">they will not take from a Naval Officer. I retired and called Brigadier Ogundipe. He went out and if an ordinary Sergeant can tell </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6285.76px;">a Brigadier 'I do not take orders from you, until my Captain comes,' I think this was the limit and this is the truth about it. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6310.53px;">Therefore, it would have been very unfair to Ogundipe or any other person for that matter to take command and there is no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6335.3px;">point accepting to command a unit over which you have no control. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6384.84px;">It was after that negotiations started, I do not know what conversation went on between Ogundipe and Jack. On the long run I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6409.62px;">was consulted and what I have just said now was exactly my advice. Bob was with me, I went out and we did not finish until </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6434.39px;">two o'clock in the morning. Jack then came into the issue, how he got there I have got the story; he himself has never told me. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6459.16px;">have been doing private investigations myself. I knew how he got into Ikeja and how it came about. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6508.7px;">I want to repeat that if we did not have the opportunity of having Jack to accept, God knows we would have been all finished. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6533.48px;">you remember, you dragged me out, things changed. I do not think people can appreciate the difficulty we were in, therefore, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6558.25px;">if anybody accepted to lead them candidly I doff my hat for him, I accept it purely from the point of respect. If 55 million </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6583.02px;">people can be saved let us forget everything about position and for God's sake because of our 55 million people let us forget </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6607.79px;">our personal pride. Whether it was a coup or a mutiny let us forget it. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6657.34px;">If this man comes out and everybody accepts him, please let us accept him.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6706.88px;">One thing I would like to repeat, I am a sailor and I want to remain a sailor. I do not see why you soldiers should not remain </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6731.65px;">soldiers. We were not trained to be politicians, let us run the Government, draw up a Constitution, hand-over to the politicians </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6756.42px;">and we get back into our uniforms. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6805.97px;">Whatever people may say, I think I will take this advantage to tell you here that when all of you were appointed Governors I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6830.74px;">was one of those who sat and appointed you Governors but right does not come into this at all; please let us forget personal </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6855.51px;">feelings. I know my rank but if it is the wish of the 55 million people, please let us put our hearts into our pockets and forget </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6880.28px;">our personal pride. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6929.83px;">Personally, I am 100 per cent in support that we should mention the whereabouts of Ironsi, even I have advised on this. When </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6954.6px;">that has been done, he is a Head of State and he should be given the proper honour; thereafter, who-so-ever is in the Chair </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 6979.37px;">now let us help him to run the country peacefully, no more bloodshed, we have shed enough. We cannot create why should </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7004.14px;">we destroy. If we can help to save please let us do so but we must say the whereabouts of Ironsi. He is a Head of State and we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7028.92px;">should give him his due respect as a Head of State. It is a temporary issue, four, five years, maybe I would have retired by then. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7078.46px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: It is all well and good, Gentlemen, but I will be vehement on this. The point is that if a room is dirty you do not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7103.23px;">sweep the dirt under the carpet because whenever you raise the carpet the dirt will be there. It is not so simple as all that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7128px;">Indeed, on the very principle that you have enunciated here, it is a question of command and control. I like to know who will </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7152.78px;">stand up here and tell me that he commands and controls the Eastern Army or the Army in the East.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7202.32px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: You alone. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7251.86px;">Commodore Wey: I can tell you also here now that you are doing it illegally because when we had the first Government no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7276.64px;">Governor was supposed to have the command of any Army.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7326.18px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: You have started on the basis of the principles of command and control. If you control a group who will take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7350.95px;">orders from you, according to you, everybody doffs his hat, well done. Right, that person you doff your hat to cannot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7375.72px;">command and control those under him and indeed those of the East. What do you do to that? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7425.27px;">Commodore Wey: That is why we are here. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7474.81px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This is why we are here to solve the problem. You command the East, if you want to come into Nigeria come </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7499.58px;">into Nigeria and that is that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7549.13px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I am not out. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7598.67px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This is the problem but if we are to go into the basis of coup and mutiny we will be here for months. I have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7623.44px;">seen an Army mutiny in Kano and if you see me trembling you will know what a mutiny is. You were the first I rang and for two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7648.22px;">good days I saw a real mutiny when a C.O. of Northern origin commanding soldiers of Northern origin had to run away. Please, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7672.99px;">we have all come not to raise issues of the past, let us forget the past and come to the problem. Say what you want to say, let </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7697.76px;">us go into the matter and discuss it.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7747.3px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Before we ask Emeka to give a solution will it not be advisable that somebody should say what happened to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7772.08px;">Ironsi Major Johnson: I support him fully. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7821.62px;">Alhaji Kam Selem: If I may just say a few words. I am not a military man, but at that time it was just impossible for anybody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7846.39px;">else to take command of the country. As far as I know even the present Supreme Commander had to be persuaded to take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7871.16px;">over the Government. The Senior Officers you are talking about could not possibly accept the leadership of the country at that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7895.94px;">time. What could we do in a situation like that and the country was kept for 48 hours and nobody knew what was happening. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7920.71px;">As far as I know he has no ambition to remain in this present post. As soon as the situation in the country returns to normal </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7945.48px;">and the problems are solved he will resign. I associate myself with all the Governors who said we should give the present </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7970.25px;">Supreme Commander the respect he deserves. I was present through the whole trouble from January 15 and most of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 7995.02px;">things took place in my office. As other speakers said, if the Governor of the East has a solution let us hear the solution. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8044.57px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: Before we hear the solution, we want to know what happened to Ironsi and Fajuyi.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8094.11px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: If a public statement is required I am prepared to make one now. I have never been afraid to make a public </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8118.88px;">statement anywhere. Left to me it would have been announced the day I knew about it and immediately I took the people that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8143.66px;">should know into confidence. I have explained this to my Colleagues in absolute sincerity and honesty. I had wanted to make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8168.43px;">the announcement before this meeting but unfortunately I was unable to do so. In any case, I want to make this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8193.2px;">announcement very shortly, and if you require it now I will say it. If you wish I can give the information in confidence and we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8217.97px;">can work on that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8267.52px;">Alhaji Kam Selem: I think the statement should be made in Nigeria so that the necessary honour can be given. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8317.06px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This was what happened after the January coup. We agreed to announce the names of all the Senior Officers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8341.83px;">killed but there was fear all over. Let us combine the whole story ready, do the whole thing respectably and solve the problem.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8391.38px;">Commodore Wey: Gentlemen, I would like to suggest this. I do not think there is anybody sitting on this table who would say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8416.15px;">that until today he did not know about the situation. In short, it is a public statement that is required and now we are going to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8440.92px;">have it in the scribe's book. We know the position and an announcement will be made as soon as we get back home. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8490.46px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: On this question of announcement and as you have all diagnosed, a lot depends on the public statement. The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8515.24px;">longer it is kept everything would remain uncertain, so that it is necessary to determine here how we are going to make this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8540.01px;">announcement. When?  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8589.55px;">Col. Adebayo: The best thing is to tell us here now what happened to Ironsi then when we get home and we issue our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8614.32px;">communique, we can make the public statement. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8663.87px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon There is a Head of State and at the moment we are all assuming something serious or tragic has happened to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8688.64px;">him. He is a Head of State, we cannot just sit down here and discuss it. As I said, it is my responsibility to make the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8713.41px;">announcement in due course and I will make it in due course. I have already made up my mind that this would be done within </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8738.18px;">the next week or two. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8787.73px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I am not trying to be difficult on the issue but perhaps you will agree that this issue affects the area I am </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8812.5px;">governing more than any other area. If it is in due course that the announcement is going to be made I would respectfully </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8837.27px;">suggest that a statement would be in due course. Let us decide, if we want the Secretaries to move out, they can move out. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8862.04px;">we want everybody out, let them go out for five minutes, the microphones can be taken away or we can move down there. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8886.82px;">Gentlemen, if even the circumstances mean quite a lot, we can move away from this table, have a quick chat and come back to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8911.59px;">continue.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 8961.13px;">Commodore Wey: I support that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9010.68px;">c. The problem of the army </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9060.22px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: I think all of us have at one time or the other discussed the situation in the country with regard to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9084.99px;">reorganisation of the Army. With reference to 3 (b) 'the implementation of the agreement reached on 9th August' this is on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9109.76px;">disposition of Army personnel, that they should go back to their region of origin. This recommendation was made by the Ad </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9134.54px;">Hoc Committee which consisted of Secretaries to the Military Governors, advisers and representatives of Regional Governors. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9159.31px;">They did not have any mandate to decide anything other than to come and express their feelings and make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9184.08px;">recommendations. Their recommendations, of course, would be considered by the Regional Governors. I think the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9208.85px;">recommendation says: </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9258.4px;">It was accordingly agreed that as far as possible the Army personnel should be posted to barracks in their Regions of origin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9283.17px;">with immediate effect as an interim measure. Having regard to its peculiar position, the question of maintenance of peace and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9307.94px;">security in Lagos should be left with the Supreme Commander in consultation with the Military Governors. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9357.48px;">This question of movement of troops to their Region of origin arose from the fact that at the time there was so much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9382.26px;">misunderstanding, so much clash and killings between troops of Northern origin and troops of Eastern origin. I discussed this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9407.03px;">on the telephone with Emeka and I told him that 'Honestly, my consideration is to save the lives of these boys and the only </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9431.8px;">way to do it is to remove the troops back to barracks in their Region of origin. ' Emeka also told me that there were a number </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9456.57px;">of threats to his life and any moment the troops in Enugu of Northern origin could mutiny and his life and the lives of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9481.34px;">people of Eastern Nigeria would be in danger. I agreed with him and said the best thing we could do was to send them back to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9506.12px;">their Region of origin and some of the boys were already escaping from their units. We agreed to repatriate all troops of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9530.89px;">Northern origin from the East and those of Eastern origin particularly Ibo speaking from the other major units because the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9555.66px;">clashes were severest within major units.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9605.2px;">As far as I was concerned I did not think the problem was in other units because the feeling at that time was that it was the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9629.98px;">Northern versus Eastern boys as a result of some things that had happened in the past which had been with us for a long </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9654.75px;">time. If you remember, Emeka, you said something about the boys in the services returning and I agreed to this reluctantly but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9679.52px;">as far as the major units were concerned, I thought that was necessary. If we can mix up a little now this will certainly be a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9704.29px;">good basis for future coming together. If we separate totally we will sort of probably get further and further apart and each </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9729.06px;">Region may have an independent Army. I think I have said enough as far as the review of the current situation with reference </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9753.84px;">to the organisation of the Army is concerned and the implementation of the agreement of 9th August. I think we can now </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9778.61px;">discuss this point and later on come to some sort of agreement on the subject....  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9828.15px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: I think we can now go to the question of the organisation of the Nigerian Army. There was a Committee that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9852.92px;">was set up in August or September to think on the re- organisation of the Nigerian Army and I think they produced a paper </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9877.7px;">which we sent to all Military Governors to comment upon and from that we will work out the question of re-organisation. This </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9902.47px;">is something on a nation's security and I think we should be very careful about it. This is the truth about defence in the world </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9927.24px;">today.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 9976.78px;">If I can say something about my idea for the re-organisation of the Army. I will be very brief. I think that the Nigerian Army </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10001.56px;">today probably would not be able to remain exactly as it was before January 15 or July 29. There has been so much fear </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10026.33px;">generated between ourselves as a result of events since the beginning of 1966 that there is something to be said towards the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10051.1px;">modification of the present stand. There are two extremes on this. One sort of saying that we remain exactly as we were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10075.87px;">before January 15 and the other which says, we go completely on Regional basis. I think those are the two extremes. In the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10100.64px;">middle of course, you have got the possibility of having an Army predominantly people of that Region in their Region. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10150.19px;">If I can express my own view or if you like you can call it my philosophy. As far as the Nigerian Army is concerned we cannot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10174.96px;">get everybody to where he was before January 15 or July 29. If we want to go to the other extreme of having Regional Armies </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10199.73px;">we are trying to have the beginning of the arms race which is what we are trying to do away with. These Regional Armies will </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10224.5px;">turn into private armies and before we know what we are doing we will start having internal troubles within the private armies </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10249.28px;">and, of course, the whole country will be in flames. My thinking is that I do not feel that the basis of trust and confidence has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10274.05px;">been completely broken, it has been disrupted, it has been shaken but with little mixing and jingling we have got between </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10298.82px;">people, I am quite convinced that it would form the basis of probably a more realistic mixing together in the future. If every </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10323.59px;">Region wants to go its own way and think one day we will meet again, I feel that it may not work properly.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10373.14px;">On immediate re-organisation, one would like to see first of all proper command and control. Secondly, we all agreed that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10397.91px;">most of the soldiers in each Region should come from that Region. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10447.45px;">The East and the Mid-West are lucky they have all their people there, unfortunately in the West, I have not got enough </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10472.22px;">Westerners in the place and the people in the West are very afraid now because a lot of their own people were killed during </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10497px;">January, July and August. I have tried to clear the fear from them but still they insist on having more Yorubas than they have at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10521.77px;">the moment. I know there are not enough Yorubas in the Army and those who are there are mostly tradesmen. I do not want </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10546.54px;">to disrupt other units, but from what I said when we last met in Lagos, we can find an immediate solution to the Yoruba </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10571.31px;">problem. That is, try and continue on the normal quota business which we started in Zaria and as a crash programme we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10596.08px;">should use Abeokuta area as a crash programme training centre for Westerners, for Mid-Westerners who cannot go to Zaria </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10620.86px;">and possibly for the Easterners who cannot go to Zaria at the moment. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10670.4px;">I still feel very strongly about this, this is the only way to clear the problem of the Yorubas and this is the only way we can get </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10695.17px;">the confidence of the people of the West because they feel they are the only people now being helped because there are not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10719.94px;">enough Yorubas in the Army. The moment we can clear this side and we get command and control properly established, I do </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10744.72px;">not think there will be any more problem That is the immediate reorganisation which I would like now but the long term one is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10769.49px;">on the paper given to us by the committee which was appointed. It is a very good paper and I am still commenting on it.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10819.03px;">d. The information media blame </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10868.58px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: On the Government Information Media, I think all the Government Information Media in the country have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10893.35px;">done terribly bad. Emeka would say the New Nigerian has been very unkind to the East </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10942.89px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: And the Post which I pay for. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 10992.44px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon Sometime I feel my problem is not with anyone but the Outlook.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11041.98px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: All the other information media have done a lot. When the Information Media in a country completely closed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11066.75px;">their eyes to what was happening, I think it is a dangerous thing. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11116.3px;">Major Johnson: Let us agree it is the situation. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11165.84px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: All of them have committed one crime or the other.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11215.38px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: The Outlook is the worst of them. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11264.93px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: The Outlook is not the worst, the Post which we all in fact pay for is the worst followed closely by the New </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11289.7px;">Nigerian. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11339.24px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Let us make a general statement on all of them, no distinction. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11388.79px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon I think we agreed that all Government Information Media should desist from making inflammatory publications </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11413.56px;">that would worsen the situation in the country. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11463.1px;">e. The administrative arrangements for the future</span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11512.65px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon I personally think Decree 34 is worth looking into. I agree that the Supreme Military Council should sit on this, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11537.42px;">think even in one of my addresses I said I would do away with any Decree that certainly tended to go towards too much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11562.19px;">centralisation and if you feel strongly about this, very good, they can be looked into. I think we will resurrect this one when we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11586.96px;">go back home and take decisions on them. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11636.51px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: We will not discuss the details but I am anxious that we find solutions. Whatever we do here we set a time for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11661.28px;">because there has been so much going on. What I am bringing up at this meeting are the things which generate the sort of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11686.05px;">suspicion we are trying very hard to avoid. If we can set a time limit I would be agreeable that all the parts of Decrees and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11710.82px;">Decrees that assume overcentralisation will be repealed. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11760.37px;">Commodore Wey: Will be looked into, supposing it is a good one? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11809.91px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: Centralisation is a word that stinks in Nigeria to-day. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11834.68px;">For that 10,000 people have been killed.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11884.23px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: We are not going back on the question of Government. I think we better make it clear what form of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11909px;">Government because up till now Emeka has been saying he does not recognise the Federal Government of Nigeria. This is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11933.77px;">main point. Let us make it clear, is the East agreeing to the present Federal Government ? If not what is the East thinking </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 11958.54px;">should be the form of Federal Government?  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12008.09px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I have said that a Government by a Council run perhaps the same as we have to-day with a Chairman with </span>

  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12082.4px;">Col. Adebayo: I do not think we should flog this thing too much. I think quite rightly a lot of powers of the Regions have been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12107.18px;">taken from them by centralising most of them, this was by some of the Decrees made by Lagos before 29th July. I think this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12131.95px;">must be looked into, the Decrees repealed and the powers must go back to the Regions. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12181.49px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Why not use the word, reviewed. We can hold a meeting when we get back home and review these Decrees.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s213" style="top: 12231.04px;">Col. Adebayo: Can we then say that all our Solicitors-General get together and discuss these Decrees?  </span>

  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1590.51px;">a. How the military looks at the politicians </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1639.53px;">General Ankrah (Ghana): I will not like to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1664.04px;">dwell rigidly on any point whatsoever </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1688.55px;">because I feel this is a domestic affair of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1713.07px;">Nigeria and, as I have always said, it is not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1737.58px;">difficult for military people to understand </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1762.09px;">each other. It is a saying that if Generals </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1786.6px;">were to meet and discuss frontiers, wars or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1811.11px;">even go into the details to forestall war, there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1835.62px;">will never be any differences or discrepancies </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1860.13px;">but unity and understanding. There will be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1884.64px;">no war because the two old boys will meet at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1909.15px;">the frontier and tell each other: 'Old boy, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1933.66px;">are not going to commit our boys to die, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1958.17px;">come on, let us keep the politicians out' and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 1982.68px;">that is the end. I am quite confident that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2007.19px;">having met here to-day, you will continue </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2031.7px;">and achieve what you are here for. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2080.73px;">What I want to stress is this, that through the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2105.24px;">annals of history we have not seen failures </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2129.75px;">with military statesmen and when military </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2154.26px;">personnel do take over the reins of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2178.77px;">Government they have proved their worth </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2203.28px;">and, I am sure and confident that the Military </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2227.79px;">regimes that have been saddled with the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2252.3px;">onerous responsibility of rebuilding and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2276.81px;">reconstructing the various countries in Africa </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2301.32px;">will not let us down. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2350.34px;">You are aware that in Nigeria now the whole </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2374.85px;">world is looking up to you as military men </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2399.36px;">and if there is any failure to reunify or even </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2423.87px;">bring perfect understanding to Nigeria as a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2448.39px;">whole, you will find that the blame will rest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2472.9px;">with us all through the centuries. There is no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2497.41px;">gainsaying this whatsoever. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2546.43px;">Whatever the situation we are soldiers and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2570.94px;">soldiers are always statesmen not politicians. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2595.45px;">They deal with a little bit of politics and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2619.96px;">diplomacy when the time comes but they are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2644.47px;">statesmen. The people first and they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2668.98px;">themselves second but if you think like the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2693.49px;">politicians do that they want fame or they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2718px;">want to be heard of and neglect your people </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2742.51px;">then, of course, I am quite sure that we as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2767.02px;">soldiers will live to regret, even our future </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2791.53px;">generations will live to regret. They will be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2816.05px;">blaming us whenever our names are called </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2840.56px;">or mentioned.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2889.58px;">Major Johnson: Gentlemen, if I can start </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2914.09px;">talking on this one, please do not think I am </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2938.6px;">taking undue advantage. Quite honestly I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2963.11px;">think we all know what brought this country </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 2987.62px;">to where we are to-day and while talking </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3012.13px;">yesterday Emeka [first name of Lt.-Col. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3036.64px;">Ojukwu] touched on a point of how, due to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3061.15px;">the situation, the politicians got what they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3085.66px;">have been waiting for to come in. While I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3110.17px;">very much welcome this Item 4 and while I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3134.68px;">know that definitely we are not going to be in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3159.19px;">Government forever, I will like to say that, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3183.71px;">please for the next six months let us leave </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3208.22px;">everything that will bring the politicians back </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3232.73px;">into the limelight out of the question. Let us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3257.24px;">go on all these things we have been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3281.75px;">discussing since yesterday because this is on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3306.26px;">the basis at which we can get our country </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3330.77px;">back on its feet. Once we can get the papers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3355.28px;">on these things out and we see them </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3379.79px;">working then we can call the Ad Hoc </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3404.3px;">Constitutional Committee to come and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3428.81px;">discuss but for now they are just going to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3453.32px;">confuse the issues more if you bring them </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3477.83px;">out to come and talk anything again. I will say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3502.34px;">let the Military Government continue for now </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3526.85px;">and after working for six months and we see </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3551.37px;">how far we can go before we start thinking of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3575.88px;">calling these people back. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3624.9px;">Commodore Wey: I 100% support what you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3649.41px;">have said. Candidly if there had ever been a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3673.92px;">time in my life when I thought somebody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3698.43px;">had hurt me sufficiently for me to wish to kill </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3722.94px;">him it was when one of these fellows opened </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3747.45px;">his mouth too wide. I think we should let </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3771.96px;">them stay where they are for the moment. It </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3796.47px;">was simply because we could not get </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3820.98px;">together and handle our affairs. Now that we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3845.49px;">have established the basis under which we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3870px;">can work please let us leave them where </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3894.51px;">they are and let us try and see how far we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3919.03px;">can work. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3968.05px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: On this statement, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 3992.56px;">Gentlemen, a lot depends on what the Ad </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4017.07px;">Hoc Constitutional Committee is. I agree </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4041.58px;">indeed that regarding other Regions it was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4066.09px;">indeed a platform for politicians, in the East </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4090.6px;">it was not. I did not send politicians to it but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4115.11px;">be it as it may, if we say we are going to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4139.62px;">continue then we must obviously get quite </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4164.13px;">satisfied the terms of running this thing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4188.64px;">properly. We have got to be able to meet and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4213.15px;">I said it outside and I repeat it here, I, as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4237.66px;">Military Governor of the East cannot meet </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4262.17px;">anywhere in Nigeria where there are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4286.69px;">Northern troops. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4335.71px;">b. The events of 29 July and the issue of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4360.22px;">Supreme Commander: the Colonels speak </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4409.24px;">Major Johnson: Sir, before we go on if I may </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4433.75px;">say something. I am happy we have got to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4458.26px;">this point again. I had wanted to take this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4482.77px;">Conference back all along because as my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4507.28px;">people say 'If you still have lice in your head, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4531.79px;">there will still be blood on your fingers :' May </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4556.3px;">I ask one question, gentlemen, is there a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4580.81px;">Central Government in Nigeria to-day? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4629.83px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: That question is such a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4654.35px;">simple one and anyone who has been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4678.86px;">listening to what I have been saying all the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4703.37px;">time would know that I do not see a Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4727.88px;">Government in Nigeria to-day. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4776.9px;">Major Johnson: Thank you, Gentlemen. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4801.41px;">think this is the crux of the whole thing and I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4825.92px;">think if I can take you back this can be a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4850.43px;">personality clash or something. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4899.45px;">I am saying here to-day that this is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4923.96px;">backbone of our problem. As far as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4948.47px;">Governor of the East is concerned there is no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4972.98px;">central government in Nigeria. You say, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 4997.49px;">Supreme Commander, but as far as he is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5022.01px;">concerned there is no Supreme Commander. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5046.52px;">I think this is where we must start from, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5071.03px;">gentlemen. Why is he not accepting that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5095.54px;">there is a Supreme Commander and we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5120.05px;">accept there is a Supreme Commander. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5169.07px;">This brings me to this Conference that was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5193.58px;">held in August. As was rightly said, this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5218.09px;">Committee was a Steering Committee. We </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5242.6px;">are all Military personnel here and we know </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5267.11px;">one thing. We have all been pointing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5291.62px;">accusing fingers at politicians that they used </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5316.13px;">to take military decisions without military </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5340.64px;">men. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5389.67px;">The main problem now is that as far as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5414.18px;">East is concerned, there is no Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5438.69px;">Government. Why? This is what we must find </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5463.2px;">out. I mentioned something about </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5487.71px;">personality clash. I remember that there was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5512.22px;">a long letter written by the Governor of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5536.73px;">East sometime ago referring to the hierarchy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5561.24px;">in the Army, the policy on seniority and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5585.75px;">things like that. He said among other things </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5610.26px;">in the letter that if even Lt.-Col. Yakubu </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5634.77px;">Gowon is Supreme Commander is he not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5659.28px;">right to ask whether it is for a period or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5683.79px;">something. For all the East knows the former </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5708.3px;">Supreme Commander is only missing and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5732.81px;">until such a time that they know his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5757.33px;">whereabouts they do not know any other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5781.84px;">Supreme Commander. These are the points </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5806.35px;">that have been brought out by the East. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5855.37px;">Gentlemen, we said this morning that we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5879.88px;">have come with open minds and we must hit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5904.39px;">the nail at the head. The East should tell us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5928.9px;">now what are their views, what are the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5953.41px;">conditions they want to demand before they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 5977.92px;">can say that there is a Central Government in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6002.43px;">Nigeria. For all we know now, nobody has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6026.94px;">seceded, the East is still part of Nigeria, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6051.45px;">West, the North and we know Nigeria as a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6075.96px;">Federation. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6124.99px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: The Mid-West please. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6174.01px;">Major Johnson: And Lagos. Nigeria is still a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6198.52px;">Federation and in a Federation there is a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6223.03px;">Central Government. Where is this Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6247.54px;">Government and who is Head of this Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6272.05px;">Government? Gentlemen, unless we clear </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6296.56px;">this one, all what we are discussing will not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6321.07px;">be good enough. What are the conditions the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6345.58px;">East demand before they can recognise what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6370.09px;">the rest of us recognise as the Central </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6394.6px;">Government? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6419.11px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I agree with you in essence </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6443.62px;">on what you have just said, Bolaji [First name </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6468.13px;">of Major Johnson], but the last bit is badly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6492.65px;">put. If you will forgive me it is not 'What </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6517.16px;">conditions do they demand before....' </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6566.18px;">If the problem is that we are trying to see </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6590.69px;">how to solve the problem of Government in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6615.2px;">the centre then I will come in. I will seek your </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6639.71px;">indulgence as I go a little bit back into what a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6664.22px;">number of people would perhaps wish to call </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6688.73px;">history.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6737.75px;">At a certain stage, we all accepted General </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6762.26px;">Ironsi as the Supreme Commander and Head </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6786.77px;">of the National Military Government. During </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6811.28px;">his regime we met or rather whilst he was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6835.79px;">about we met as often as it was practicable, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6860.31px;">and sat and jointly discussed and took </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6884.82px;">decisions. When the decisions were good we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6909.33px;">all shared the kudos, when those decisions </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6933.84px;">were bad it is only natural that we should all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 6958.35px;">share the blame. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7007.37px;">On the 29th of July, whilst he was visiting the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7031.88px;">Governor of the West, he was said to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7056.39px;">besieged in that residence in Ibadan and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7080.9px;">later kidnapped, further abducted. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7105.41px;">Subsequent to that, it appeared in his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7129.92px;">absence the normal thing was whoever is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7154.43px;">next senior person to manage the affairs of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7178.94px;">this country until such a time as he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7203.45px;">reappeared; or it was necessary he was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7227.97px;">deposed or if he had suffered certain </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7252.48px;">accident, until such a time as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7276.99px;">circumstances were made known. Which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7301.5px;">ever is the case, the question of the headship </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7326.01px;">of the Government and the Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7350.52px;">Commander of the Armed Forces would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7375.03px;">normally be subjected to a discussion and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7399.54px;">agreement unless, of course, one party felt </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7424.05px;">he was strong enough to push everybody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7448.56px;">aside and get to the seat. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7497.58px;">When this affair of the 29th July occurred, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7522.09px;">remember for certain, the first 24 hours </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7546.6px;">nobody thought it necessary to contact the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7571.11px;">East from Lagos. I made the contact later and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7595.62px;">I know the advice I gave Brigadier Ogundipe </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7620.14px;">at that time. I said to him, 'Sir, the situation is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7644.65px;">so confused that I feel that somebody must </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7669.16px;">take control immediately. Also, I would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7693.67px;">suggest that you go on to the air and tell the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7718.18px;">country what has happened and that you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7742.69px;">were taking control of the situation.' Then I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7767.2px;">was told about concern for the whole </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7791.71px;">country. I knew that if this thing resolved </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7816.22px;">itself into factions we would get ourselves </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7840.73px;">into so much trouble that we would never or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7865.24px;">we would find it difficult to get out. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7889.75px;">maintained and still do that the answer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7914.26px;">would have been for the responsible officers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7938.77px;">of the Army to get together thereby trying to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7963.29px;">get the Army together to solve the problem </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 7987.8px;">that we had on our hands. I said to him 'As </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8012.31px;">soon as you have made your speech I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8036.82px;">guarantee you within 30 minutes, I needed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8061.33px;">time to write my own, in 30 minutes I would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8085.84px;">come on to the air in the East and say that I, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8110.35px;">the entire Army in the East and the entire </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8134.86px;">people in the East wholeheartedly support </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8159.37px;">you.' </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8208.39px;">Forgive me, David [first name of Lt.-Col. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8232.9px;">Ejoor], that I have never said this to you, but I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8257.41px;">told him too that I was sure that within </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8281.92px;">fifteen minutes you would say the same in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8306.43px;">the interest of the country as a whole. He </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8330.95px;">told me that he thought it was a good idea </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8355.46px;">but it did not seem likely that it would be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8379.97px;">accepted by the faction. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8428.99px;">Very soon after, I had occasion to talk to you, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8453.5px;">Jack [nickname of Lt.-Col. Gowon], I did </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8478.01px;">mention amongst other things, two things. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8502.52px;">The first one was this question of solving the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8527.03px;">problem and I thought the Army together </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8551.54px;">should solve it. I said also that any break at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8576.05px;">this time from our normalline would write in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8600.56px;">something into the Nigerian Army which is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8625.07px;">bigger than all of us and that thing is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8649.58px;">indiscipline. How can you ride above people's </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8674.09px;">heads and sit in Lagos purely because you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8698.61px;">are at the Head of a group who have their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8723.12px;">fingers poised on the trigger? If you do it you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8747.63px;">remain forever a living example of that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8772.14px;">indiscipline which we want to get rid of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8796.65px;">because tomorrow a Corporal will think </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8821.16px;">because he has his finger on the trigger he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8845.67px;">could just take over the company from the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8870.18px;">Major Commanding the company and so on. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8894.69px;">I knew then that we were heading for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8919.2px;">something terrible. Despite that and by force </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8943.71px;">of circumstance as we did talk on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8968.22px;">telephone, I think twice, you brought up the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 8992.73px;">question of supreme command and I made </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9017.24px;">quite plain my objections, but despite those </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9041.75px;">objections you announced yourself as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9066.26px;">Supreme Commander. Now, Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9090.78px;">Commander by virtue of the fact that you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9115.29px;">head or that you are acceptable to people </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9139.8px;">who had mutinied against their Commander, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9164.31px;">kidnapped him and taken him away ? By </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9188.82px;">virtue of the support of Officers and men </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9213.33px;">who had in the dead of night murdered their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9237.84px;">brother Officers, by virtue of the fact that you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9262.35px;">stood at the head of a group who had turned </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9286.86px;">their brother Officers from the Eastern </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9311.37px;">Region out of the barracks which they shared </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9335.88px;">? Our people came home, there are other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9360.39px;">circumstances which even make the return </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9384.9px;">more tragic. Immediately after I had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9409.42px;">opportunity to speak to you again, I said on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9433.93px;">that occasion that there had been too much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9458.44px;">killing in Nigeria and it was my sincere hope </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9482.95px;">that we can stop these killings. I said then, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9507.46px;">and have continued to say that in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9531.97px;">interest of peace I would co-operate with you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9556.48px;">to stop the fighting, to stop the killing but I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9580.99px;">would not recognise. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9630.01px;">I would not recognise because as I said we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9654.52px;">have a Supreme Commander who is missing. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9679.03px;">I would not recognise and to underline the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9703.54px;">validity of that claim of mine you appointed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9728.05px;">another Officer, be he senior to you, Acting </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9752.56px;">Governor in the West, presumably acting for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9777.07px;">the Governor who was then abducted and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9801.59px;">that I saw no reason why your position </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9826.1px;">would not then be acting. From there I think </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9850.61px;">we started parting our ways because it was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9875.12px;">clear that the hold on Lagos was by force of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9899.63px;">conquest. Now, these things do happen in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9924.14px;">the world, we are all military Officers. If an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9948.65px;">Officer is dead 'Oh! he was a fine soldier', we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9973.16px;">drop the national flag on him, we give him </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 9997.67px;">due honours and that is all. The next person </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10022.18px;">steps in. So, the actual fact in itself is a small </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10046.69px;">thing with military men but hierachy, order is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10071.2px;">very important, discipline are sine qua non </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10095.71px;">for any organisation which prides itself for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10120.22px;">being called an Army. So, the mutiny had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10144.73px;">occurred, the mutineer seemed in control of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10169.25px;">the North, the West, Lagos. By international </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10193.76px;">standards when that does happen then a de </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10218.27px;">facto situation is created immediately where </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10242.78px;">whoever is in a position get a de facto </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10267.29px;">recognition of himself in a position over the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10291.8px;">area he controls. In this situation, Nigeria </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10316.31px;">resolved itself into three areas. The Lagos, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10340.82px;">West and North group, the Mid-West, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10365.33px;">East. What should have been done is for us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10389.84px;">to get round to discuss the future, how to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10414.35px;">carry on in the absence of our Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10438.86px;">Commander.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10487.88px;">We could not get together because of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10512.39px;">situation so we sent our accredited </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10536.91px;">representatives, delegates of Governments </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10561.42px;">and personal representatives of Governors </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10585.93px;">to Lagos to try and resolve certain issues on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10610.44px;">bringing normalcy to the country. They met </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10634.95px;">and unanimously agreed to certain points.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10683.97px;">Bolaji, I think in fact from this, if nothing else </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10708.48px;">you do know what I consider went wrong. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10732.99px;">Perhaps at this juncture I might stop for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10757.5px;">others to contribute otherwise I would go on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10782.01px;">and tell you what I consider to be my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10806.52px;">solution to the problem even now, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10831.03px;">irrespective of the amount of water that had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10855.54px;">gone under the bridge. I think there is still a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10880.05px;">solution provided we are honest with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10904.57px;">ourselves and we are really very serious </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10929.08px;">about solving this problem. I agree with you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10953.59px;">it is vital, it is crucial, without it I do not think </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 10978.1px;">we can really go anywhere. I leave it for the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11002.61px;">time being. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11051.63px;">Col. Adebayo: I think Emeka has narrated </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11076.14px;">what happened on the 29th July and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11100.65px;">thereafter. We have all agreed and I am sure </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11125.16px;">you still agree that what we are looking for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11149.67px;">now is a solution for the future. I do not want </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11174.18px;">us to go into the past anymore, we want a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11198.69px;">solution for the future. I will suggest with the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11223.2px;">permission of the other members here that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11247.71px;">we ask Emeka to give us his solution. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11272.23px;">Thereafter there might be some others too </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11296.74px;">who would have their own solutions, then we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11321.25px;">can make a compromise from the solutions </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11345.76px;">we get. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11394.78px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: Gentlemen, General Ankrah </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11419.29px;">told us not to go back into the past, if we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11443.8px;">to go back into the past we will sit here for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11468.31px;">two months talking. Let us forget the past </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11492.82px;">and I agree with Robert [first name of Col. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11517.33px;">Adebayo] that we ask the East to tell us their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11541.84px;">solution. If their solution is quite acceptable </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11566.35px;">then we adopt it, amend or whatever we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11590.86px;">think is good for the country for peace. We </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11615.37px;">are not going to say ourselves what efforts </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11639.89px;">we have put in individually; let us find peace </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11664.4px;">for Nigeria. This is the major issue, unless </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11688.91px;">this is done whatever we are going to discuss </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11713.42px;">is not going to work out well.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11762.44px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: I believe that before we start </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11786.95px;">suggesting solutions we must examine </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11811.46px;">certain principles vis a vis the Governors. To </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11835.97px;">me, we should not go too far into history but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11860.48px;">there is one valid point which must be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11884.99px;">considered and that is the coup we have had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11909.5px;">so far. The January 15 one was a failure and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11934.01px;">the Army came in to correct it, the one of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11958.52px;">29th I personally believe was a mutiny to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 11983.03px;">start with but it has now turned out to be a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12007.54px;">coup. If it is a coup we have to ask ourselves </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12032.06px;">'is it a successful coup or is it a partial one ?' I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12056.57px;">believe it is a partial one, it is not a fully </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12081.08px;">successful one. This is the main point which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12105.59px;">has brought us here, trying to negotiate as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12130.1px;">opposed to receiving orders from the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12154.61px;">Commander. I think we must bear this in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12179.12px;">mind in reaching a decision or a Resolution </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12203.63px;">affecting the re-organisation of the Army. To-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12228.14px;">day, the Army is faced with four main </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12252.65px;">problems. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12301.67px;">Firstly, the problem of leadership; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12350.7px;">Secondly, the crisis of confidence amongst </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12375.21px;">Officers and amongst the soldiers; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12424.23px;">Thirdly, the chain of command is badly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12448.74px;">disrupted; and Fourthly, we cannot now have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12473.25px;">any Nigerian from anywhere serving in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12497.76px;">same unit as an effective unit of the Army. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12546.78px;">These are bare facts and whatever solution </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12571.29px;">we evolve must go to solve these main </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12595.8px;">problems. I leave these basic principles and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12620.31px;">what solutions offered should be considered </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12644.82px;">alongside these problems. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12693.84px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: David spoke on re-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12718.35px;">organisation but the current topic is on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12742.87px;">Bolaji's point which Emeka narrated. I think </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12767.38px;">this is the major point. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12816.4px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: When you consider leadership </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12840.91px;">you have to tell us what happened to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12865.42px;">former leader. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12914.44px;">Commodore Wey: Gentlemen, I think I have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12938.95px;">been properly placed in this issue from the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12963.46px;">15th of January up till now. Unfortunately, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 12987.97px;">do not put them down because I think I can </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13012.48px;">carry quite a bit in my head. The whole issue </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13036.99px;">is unfortunate, it has happened and it has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13061.5px;">happened. The truth now is that we want to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13086.01px;">repair, we do not intend to point accusing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13110.53px;">fingers at anybody. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13159.55px;">When the trouble of the 29th July started I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13184.06px;">was present, you came and joined us, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13208.57px;">therefore, I can tell any other person better. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13233.08px;">was there when you phoned Brigadier </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13257.59px;">Ogundipe and I knew what you said. At one </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13282.1px;">stage, it was even said that I carried him in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13306.61px;">my ship and took him out to sea. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13355.63px;">I must say one thing that it is impossible for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13380.14px;">any man to expect to command any unit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13404.65px;">which he has not got control over. Bolaji </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13429.16px;">would bear witness, he was there, he started </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13453.67px;">it. He was the one who went out first and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13478.18px;">came back to say that a Private refused to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13502.7px;">take orders from him; it all happened in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13527.21px;">Police Headquarters.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13576.23px;">The Inspector-General complained, I went </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13600.74px;">into it and I said if they cannot take orders </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13625.25px;">from an Army Officer like themselves they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13649.76px;">will not take from a Naval Officer. I retired </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13674.27px;">and called Brigadier Ogundipe. He went out </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13698.78px;">and if an ordinary Sergeant can tell a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13723.29px;">Brigadier 'I do not take orders from you, until </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13747.8px;">my Captain comes,' I think this was the limit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13772.31px;">and this is the truth about it. Therefore, it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13796.82px;">would have been very unfair to Ogundipe or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13821.33px;">any other person for that matter to take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13845.85px;">command and there is no point accepting to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13870.36px;">command a unit over which you have no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13894.87px;">control. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13943.89px;">It was after that negotiations started, I do not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13968.4px;">know what conversation went on between </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 13992.91px;">Ogundipe and Jack. On the long run I was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14017.42px;">consulted and what I have just said now was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14041.93px;">exactly my advice. Bob was with me, I went </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14066.44px;">out and we did not finish until two o'clock in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14090.95px;">the morning. Jack then came into the issue, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14115.46px;">how he got there I have got the story; he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14139.97px;">himself has never told me. I have been doing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14164.48px;">private investigations myself. I knew how he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14189px;">got into Ikeja and how it came about. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14238.02px;">I want to repeat that if we did not have the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14262.53px;">opportunity of having Jack to accept, God </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14287.04px;">knows we would have been all finished. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14311.55px;">you remember, you dragged me out, things </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14336.06px;">changed. I do not think people can </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14360.57px;">appreciate the difficulty we were in, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14385.08px;">therefore, if anybody accepted to lead them </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14409.59px;">candidly I doff my hat for him, I accept it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14434.1px;">purely from the point of respect. If 55 million </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14458.61px;">people can be saved let us forget everything </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14483.12px;">about position and for God's sake because of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14507.63px;">our 55 million people let us forget our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14532.14px;">personal pride. Whether it was a coup or a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14556.65px;">mutiny let us forget it. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14605.68px;">If this man comes out and everybody accepts </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14630.19px;">him, please let us accept him.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14679.21px;">One thing I would like to repeat, I am a sailor </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14703.72px;">and I want to remain a sailor. I do not see </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14728.23px;">why you soldiers should not remain soldiers. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14752.74px;">We were not trained to be politicians, let us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14777.25px;">run the Government, draw up a Constitution, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14801.76px;">hand-over to the politicians and we get back </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14826.27px;">into our uniforms. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14875.29px;">Whatever people may say, I think I will take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14899.8px;">this advantage to tell you here that when all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14924.31px;">of you were appointed Governors I was one </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14948.83px;">of those who sat and appointed you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14973.34px;">Governors but right does not come into this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 14997.85px;">at all; please let us forget personal feelings. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15022.36px;">know my rank but if it is the wish of the 55 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15046.87px;">million people, please let us put our hearts </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15071.38px;">into our pockets and forget our personal </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15095.89px;">pride. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15144.91px;">Personally, I am 100 per cent in support that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15169.42px;">we should mention the whereabouts of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15193.93px;">Ironsi, even I have advised on this. When that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15218.44px;">has been done, he is a Head of State and he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15242.95px;">should be given the proper honour; </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15267.46px;">thereafter, who-so-ever is in the Chair now </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15291.98px;">let us help him to run the country peacefully, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15316.49px;">no more bloodshed, we have shed enough. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15341px;">We cannot create why should we destroy. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15365.51px;">we can help to save please let us do so but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15390.02px;">we must say the whereabouts of Ironsi. He is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15414.53px;">a Head of State and we should give him his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15439.04px;">due respect as a Head of State. It is a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15463.55px;">temporary issue, four, five years, maybe I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15488.06px;">would have retired by then. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15537.08px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: It is all well and good, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15561.59px;">Gentlemen, but I will be vehement on this. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15586.1px;">The point is that if a room is dirty you do not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15610.61px;">sweep the dirt under the carpet because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15635.12px;">whenever you raise the carpet the dirt will be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15659.63px;">there. It is not so simple as all that. Indeed, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15684.15px;">on the very principle that you have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15708.66px;">enunciated here, it is a question of command </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15733.17px;">and control. I like to know who will stand up </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15757.68px;">here and tell me that he commands and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15782.19px;">controls the Eastern Army or the Army in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15806.7px;">East.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15855.72px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: You alone. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15904.74px;">Commodore Wey: I can tell you also here </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15929.25px;">now that you are doing it illegally because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15953.76px;">when we had the first Government no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 15978.27px;">Governor was supposed to have the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16002.78px;">command of any Army.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16051.8px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: You have started on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16076.32px;">basis of the principles of command and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16100.83px;">control. If you control a group who will take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16125.34px;">orders from you, according to you, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16149.85px;">everybody doffs his hat, well done. Right, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16174.36px;">that person you doff your hat to cannot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16198.87px;">command and control those under him and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16223.38px;">indeed those of the East. What do you do to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16247.89px;">that? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16296.91px;">Commodore Wey: That is why we are here. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16345.93px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This is why we are here to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16370.44px;">solve the problem. You command the East, if </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16394.96px;">you want to come into Nigeria come into </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16419.46px;">Nigeria and that is that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16468.49px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I am not out. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16517.51px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This is the problem but if we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16542.02px;">are to go into the basis of coup and mutiny </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16566.53px;">we will be here for months. I have seen an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16591.04px;">Army mutiny in Kano and if you see me </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16615.55px;">trembling you will know what a mutiny is. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16640.06px;">You were the first I rang and for two good </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16664.57px;">days I saw a real mutiny when a C.O. of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16689.08px;">Northern origin commanding soldiers of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16713.59px;">Northern origin had to run away. Please, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16738.11px;">have all come not to raise issues of the past, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16762.62px;">let us forget the past and come to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16787.12px;">problem. Say what you want to say, let us go </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16811.63px;">into the matter and discuss it.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16860.66px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Before we ask Emeka to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16885.17px;">give a solution will it not be advisable that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16909.68px;">somebody should say what happened to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16934.19px;">Ironsi Major Johnson: I support him fully. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 16983.21px;">Alhaji Kam Selem: If I may just say a few </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17007.72px;">words. I am not a military man, but at that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17032.23px;">time it was just impossible for anybody else </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17056.74px;">to take command of the country. As far as I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17081.25px;">know even the present Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17105.76px;">Commander had to be persuaded to take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17130.28px;">over the Government. The Senior Officers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17154.79px;">you are talking about could not possibly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17179.3px;">accept the leadership of the country at that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17203.81px;">time. What could we do in a situation like </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17228.32px;">that and the country was kept for 48 hours </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17252.83px;">and nobody knew what was happening. As </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17277.34px;">far as I know he has no ambition to remain in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17301.85px;">this present post. As soon as the situation in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17326.36px;">the country returns to normal and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17350.87px;">problems are solved he will resign. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17375.38px;">associate myself with all the Governors who </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17399.89px;">said we should give the present Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17424.4px;">Commander the respect he deserves. I was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17448.91px;">present through the whole trouble from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17473.42px;">January 15 and most of the things took place </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17497.93px;">in my office. As other speakers said, if the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17522.45px;">Governor of the East has a solution let us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17546.96px;">hear the solution. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17595.98px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: Before we hear the solution, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17620.49px;">we want to know what happened to Ironsi </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17645px;">and Fajuyi.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17694.02px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: If a public statement is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17718.53px;">required I am prepared to make one now. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17743.04px;">have never been afraid to make a public </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17767.55px;">statement anywhere. Left to me it would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17792.06px;">have been announced the day I knew about </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17816.57px;">it and immediately I took the people that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17841.08px;">should know into confidence. I have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17865.59px;">explained this to my Colleagues in absolute </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17890.11px;">sincerity and honesty. I had wanted to make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17914.62px;">the announcement before this meeting but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17939.13px;">unfortunately I was unable to do so. In any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17963.64px;">case, I want to make this announcement very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 17988.15px;">shortly, and if you require it now I will say it. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18012.66px;">If you wish I can give the information in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18037.17px;">confidence and we can work on that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18086.19px;">Alhaji Kam Selem: I think the statement </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18110.7px;">should be made in Nigeria so that the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18135.21px;">necessary honour can be given. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18184.23px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: This was what happened </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18208.74px;">after the January coup. We agreed to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18233.26px;">announce the names of all the Senior </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18257.77px;">Officers killed but there was fear all over. Let </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18282.28px;">us combine the whole story ready, do the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18306.79px;">whole thing respectably and solve the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18331.3px;">problem.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18380.32px;">Commodore Wey: Gentlemen, I would like to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18404.83px;">suggest this. I do not think there is anybody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18429.34px;">sitting on this table who would say that until </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18453.85px;">today he did not know about the situation. In </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18478.36px;">short, it is a public statement that is required </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18502.87px;">and now we are going to have it in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18527.38px;">scribe's book. We know the position and an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18551.89px;">announcement will be made as soon as we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18576.4px;">get back home. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18625.43px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: On this question of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18649.94px;">announcement and as you have all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18674.45px;">diagnosed, a lot depends on the public </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18698.96px;">statement. The longer it is kept everything </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18723.47px;">would remain uncertain, so that it is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18747.98px;">necessary to determine here how we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18772.49px;">going to make this announcement. When?  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18821.51px;">Col. Adebayo: The best thing is to tell us here </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18846.02px;">now what happened to Ironsi then when we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18870.53px;">get home and we issue our communique, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18895.04px;">can make the public statement. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18944.06px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon There is a Head of State and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18968.57px;">at the moment we are all assuming </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 18993.08px;">something serious or tragic has happened to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19017.6px;">him. He is a Head of State, we cannot just sit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19042.11px;">down here and discuss it. As I said, it is my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19066.62px;">responsibility to make the announcement in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19091.13px;">due course and I will make it in due course. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19115.64px;">have already made up my mind that this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19140.15px;">would be done within the next week or two. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19189.17px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I am not trying to be difficult </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19213.68px;">on the issue but perhaps you will agree that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19238.19px;">this issue affects the area I am governing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19262.7px;">more than any other area. If it is in due </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19287.21px;">course that the announcement is going to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19311.72px;">made I would respectfully suggest that a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19336.23px;">statement would be in due course. Let us </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19360.74px;">decide, if we want the Secretaries to move </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19385.26px;">out, they can move out. If we want everybody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19409.77px;">out, let them go out for five minutes, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19434.28px;">microphones can be taken away or we can </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19458.79px;">move down there. Gentlemen, if even the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19483.3px;">circumstances mean quite a lot, we can move </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19507.81px;">away from this table, have a quick chat and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19532.32px;">come back to continue.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19581.34px;">Commodore Wey: I support that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19630.36px;">c. The problem of the army </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19679.38px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: I think all of us have at one </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19703.89px;">time or the other discussed the situation in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19728.41px;">the country with regard to the reorganisation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19752.92px;">of the Army. With reference to 3 (b) 'the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19777.43px;">implementation of the agreement reached </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19801.94px;">on 9th August' this is on the disposition of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19826.45px;">Army personnel, that they should go back to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19850.96px;">their region of origin. This recommendation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19875.47px;">was made by the Ad Hoc Committee which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19899.98px;">consisted of Secretaries to the Military </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19924.49px;">Governors, advisers and representatives of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19949px;">Regional Governors. They did not have any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19973.51px;">mandate to decide anything other than to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 19998.02px;">come and express their feelings and make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20022.53px;">recommendations. Their recommendations, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20047.04px;">of course, would be considered by the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20071.55px;">Regional Governors. I think the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20096.07px;">recommendation says: </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20145.09px;">It was accordingly agreed that as far as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20169.6px;">possible the Army personnel should be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20194.11px;">posted to barracks in their Regions of origin </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20218.62px;">with immediate effect as an interim </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20243.13px;">measure. Having regard to its peculiar </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20267.64px;">position, the question of maintenance of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20292.15px;">peace and security in Lagos should be left </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20316.66px;">with the Supreme Commander in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20341.17px;">consultation with the Military Governors. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20390.19px;">This question of movement of troops to their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20414.7px;">Region of origin arose from the fact that at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20439.21px;">the time there was so much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20463.73px;">misunderstanding, so much clash and killings </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20488.24px;">between troops of Northern origin and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20512.75px;">troops of Eastern origin. I discussed this on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20537.26px;">the telephone with Emeka and I told him that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20561.77px;">'Honestly, my consideration is to save the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20586.28px;">lives of these boys and the only way to do it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20610.79px;">is to remove the troops back to barracks in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20635.3px;">their Region of origin. ' Emeka also told me </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20659.81px;">that there were a number of threats to his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20684.32px;">life and any moment the troops in Enugu of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20708.83px;">Northern origin could mutiny and his life and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20733.34px;">the lives of the people of Eastern Nigeria </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20757.85px;">would be in danger. I agreed with him and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20782.37px;">said the best thing we could do was to send </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20806.88px;">them back to their Region of origin and some </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20831.38px;">of the boys were already escaping from their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20855.9px;">units. We agreed to repatriate all troops of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20880.41px;">Northern origin from the East and those of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20904.92px;">Eastern origin particularly Ibo speaking from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20929.43px;">the other major units because the clashes </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 20953.94px;">were severest within major units.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21002.96px;">As far as I was concerned I did not think the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21027.47px;">problem was in other units because the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21051.98px;">feeling at that time was that it was the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21076.49px;">Northern versus Eastern boys as a result of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21101px;">some things that had happened in the past </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21125.51px;">which had been with us for a long time. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21150.02px;">you remember, Emeka, you said something </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21174.54px;">about the boys in the services returning and I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21199.04px;">agreed to this reluctantly but as far as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21223.55px;">major units were concerned, I thought that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21248.07px;">was necessary. If we can mix up a little now </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21272.58px;">this will certainly be a good basis for future </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21297.09px;">coming together. If we separate totally we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21321.6px;">will sort of probably get further and further </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21346.11px;">apart and each Region may have an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21370.62px;">independent Army. I think I have said enough </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21395.13px;">as far as the review of the current situation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21419.64px;">with reference to the organisation of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21444.15px;">Army is concerned and the implementation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21468.66px;">of the agreement of 9th August. I think we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21493.17px;">can now discuss this point and later on come </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21517.68px;">to some sort of agreement on the subject....  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21566.71px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: I think we can now go to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21591.22px;">question of the organisation of the Nigerian </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21615.73px;">Army. There was a Committee that was set </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21640.24px;">up in August or September to think on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21664.75px;">re- organisation of the Nigerian Army and I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21689.26px;">think they produced a paper which we sent </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21713.77px;">to all Military Governors to comment upon </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21738.28px;">and from that we will work out the question </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21762.79px;">of re-organisation. This is something on a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21787.3px;">nation's security and I think we should be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21811.81px;">very careful about it. This is the truth about </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21836.32px;">defence in the world today.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21885.34px;">If I can say something about my idea for the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21909.85px;">re-organisation of the Army. I will be very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21934.37px;">brief. I think that the Nigerian Army today </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21958.88px;">probably would not be able to remain exactly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 21983.39px;">as it was before January 15 or July 29. There </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22007.9px;">has been so much fear generated between </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22032.41px;">ourselves as a result of events since the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22056.92px;">beginning of 1966 that there is something to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22081.43px;">be said towards the modification of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22105.94px;">present stand. There are two extremes on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22130.45px;">this. One sort of saying that we remain </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22154.96px;">exactly as we were before January 15 and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22179.47px;">other which says, we go completely on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22203.98px;">Regional basis. I think those are the two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22228.49px;">extremes. In the middle of course, you have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22253px;">got the possibility of having an Army </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22277.52px;">predominantly people of that Region in their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22302.03px;">Region. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22351.05px;">If I can express my own view or if you like you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22375.56px;">can call it my philosophy. As far as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22400.07px;">Nigerian Army is concerned we cannot get </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22424.58px;">everybody to where he was before January </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22449.09px;">15 or July 29. If we want to go to the other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22473.6px;">extreme of having Regional Armies we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22498.11px;">trying to have the beginning of the arms race </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22522.62px;">which is what we are trying to do away with. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22547.13px;">These Regional Armies will turn into private </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22571.64px;">armies and before we know what we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22596.15px;">doing we will start having internal troubles </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22620.66px;">within the private armies and, of course, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22645.17px;">whole country will be in flames. My thinking </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22669.69px;">is that I do not feel that the basis of trust and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22694.2px;">confidence has been completely broken, it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22718.71px;">has been disrupted, it has been shaken but </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22743.22px;">with little mixing and jingling we have got </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22767.73px;">between people, I am quite convinced that it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22792.24px;">would form the basis of probably a more </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22816.75px;">realistic mixing together in the future. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22841.26px;">every Region wants to go its own way and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22865.77px;">think one day we will meet again, I feel that it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22890.28px;">may not work properly.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22939.3px;">On immediate re-organisation, one would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22963.81px;">like to see first of all proper command and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 22988.33px;">control. Secondly, we all agreed that most of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23012.84px;">the soldiers in each Region should come </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23037.34px;">from that Region. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23086.37px;">The East and the Mid-West are lucky they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23110.88px;">have all their people there, unfortunately in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23135.39px;">the West, I have not got enough Westerners </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23159.9px;">in the place and the people in the West are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23184.41px;">very afraid now because a lot of their own </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23208.92px;">people were killed during January, July and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23233.43px;">August. I have tried to clear the fear from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23257.94px;">them but still they insist on having more </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23282.45px;">Yorubas than they have at the moment. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23306.96px;">know there are not enough Yorubas in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23331.47px;">Army and those who are there are mostly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23355.98px;">tradesmen. I do not want to disrupt other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23380.5px;">units, but from what I said when we last met </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23405.01px;">in Lagos, we can find an immediate solution </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23429.52px;">to the Yoruba problem. That is, try and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23454.03px;">continue on the normal quota business </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23478.54px;">which we started in Zaria and as a crash </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23503.05px;">programme we should use Abeokuta area as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23527.56px;">a crash programme training centre for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23552.07px;">Westerners, for Mid-Westerners who cannot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23576.58px;">go to Zaria and possibly for the Easterners </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23601.09px;">who cannot go to Zaria at the moment. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23650.11px;">I still feel very strongly about this, this is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23674.62px;">only way to clear the problem of the Yorubas </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23699.13px;">and this is the only way we can get the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23723.64px;">confidence of the people of the West </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23748.15px;">because they feel they are the only people </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23772.67px;">now being helped because there are not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23797.18px;">enough Yorubas in the Army. The moment </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23821.69px;">we can clear this side and we get command </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23846.2px;">and control properly established, I do not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23870.71px;">think there will be any more problem That is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23895.22px;">the immediate reorganisation which I would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23919.73px;">like now but the long term one is on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23944.24px;">paper given to us by the committee which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23968.75px;">was appointed. It is a very good paper and I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 23993.26px;">am still commenting on it.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24042.28px;">d. The information media blame </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24091.3px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon: On the Government </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24115.81px;">Information Media, I think all the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24140.33px;">Government Information Media in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24164.84px;">country have done terribly bad. Emeka </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24189.35px;">would say the New Nigerian has been very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24213.86px;">unkind to the East </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24262.88px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: And the Post which I pay for. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24311.9px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon Sometime I feel my problem </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24336.41px;">is not with anyone but the Outlook.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24385.43px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: All the other information </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24409.94px;">media have done a lot. When the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24434.45px;">Information Media in a country completely </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24458.96px;">closed their eyes to what was happening, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24483.47px;">think it is a dangerous thing. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24532.5px;">Major Johnson: Let us agree it is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24557.01px;">situation. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24606.03px;">Lt.-Col. Ejoor: All of them have committed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24630.54px;">one crime or the other.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24679.56px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: The Outlook is the worst of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24704.07px;">them. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24753.09px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: The Outlook is not the worst, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24777.6px;">the Post which we all in fact pay for is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24802.11px;">worst followed closely by the New Nigerian. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24851.14px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Let us make a general </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24875.64px;">statement on all of them, no distinction. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24924.67px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon I think we agreed that all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24949.18px;">Government Information Media should </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24973.69px;">desist from making inflammatory </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 24998.2px;">publications that would worsen the situation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25022.71px;">in the country. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25071.73px;">e. The administrative arrangements for the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25096.24px;">future</span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25145.26px;">Lt.-Col. Gowon I personally think Decree 34 is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25169.77px;">worth looking into. I agree that the Supreme </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25194.28px;">Military Council should sit on this, I think </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25218.79px;">even in one of my addresses I said I would do </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25243.31px;">away with any Decree that certainly tended </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25267.81px;">to go towards too much centralisation and if </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25292.33px;">you feel strongly about this, very good, they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25316.84px;">can be looked into. I think we will resurrect </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25341.35px;">this one when we go back home and take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25365.86px;">decisions on them. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25414.88px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: We will not discuss the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25439.39px;">details but I am anxious that we find </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25463.9px;">solutions. Whatever we do here we set a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25488.41px;">time for because there has been so much </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25512.92px;">going on. What I am bringing up at this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25537.44px;">meeting are the things which generate the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25561.95px;">sort of suspicion we are trying very hard to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25586.45px;">avoid. If we can set a time limit I would be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25610.96px;">agreeable that all the parts of Decrees and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25635.48px;">Decrees that assume overcentralisation will </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25659.99px;">be repealed. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25709.01px;">Commodore Wey: Will be looked into, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25733.52px;">supposing it is a good one? </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25782.54px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: Centralisation is a word that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25807.05px;">stinks in Nigeria to-day. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25831.56px;">For that 10,000 people have been killed.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25880.58px;">Lt.-Col. Hassan: We are not going back on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25905.09px;">question of Government. I think we better </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25929.61px;">make it clear what form of Government </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25954.12px;">because up till now Emeka has been saying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 25978.62px;">he does not recognise the Federal </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26003.14px;">Government of Nigeria. This is the main </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26027.65px;">point. Let us make it clear, is the East </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26052.16px;">agreeing to the present Federal Government </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26076.67px;">? If not what is the East thinking should be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26101.18px;">the form of Federal Government?  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26150.2px;">Lt.-Col. Ojukwu: I have said that a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26174.71px;">Government by a Council run perhaps the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26199.22px;">same as we have to-day with a Chairman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26223.73px;">with limited powers and we limit the powers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26248.24px;">here.... </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26297.26px;">Col. Adebayo: I do not think we should flog </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26321.78px;">this thing too much. I think quite rightly a lot </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26346.29px;">of powers of the Regions have been taken </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26370.79px;">from them by centralising most of them, this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26395.31px;">was by some of the Decrees made by Lagos </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26419.82px;">before 29th July. I think this must be looked </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26444.33px;">into, the Decrees repealed and the powers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26468.84px;">must go back to the Regions. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26517.86px;">Mr. T. Omo-Bare: Why not use the word, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26542.37px;">reviewed. We can hold a meeting when we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26566.88px;">get back home and review these Decrees.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26615.9px;">Col. Adebayo: Can we then say that all our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26640.41px;">Solicitors-General get together and discuss </span>
  <span class="xr_tl Normal_Text xr_s38" style="top: 26664.92px;">these Decrees?  </span>
